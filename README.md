# eee_project (fault detection)
This repository contains an AI program developed for fault detection in transmission lines using the decision tree algorithm.

The program utilizes decision trees to analyze data and make accurate predictions regarding the presence of faults in transmission lines. It aims to enhance the reliability and efficiency of electrical infrastructure by providing a robust and efficient solution for fault detection.

Users can easily deploy and integrate this program into their existing systems to improve maintenance strategies and minimize downtime associated with transmission line faults.
